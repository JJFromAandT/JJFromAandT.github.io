            Now that you know my name, I'll tell you a little bit about myself. 
            I'm a Junior Computer Science student that attends North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. 
            I don't have siblings, but I have a big family. My hobbies are extreamly varried, but I like to play video games, exercise,
            hang out with friends, watch anime, participate in hackathons, travel, and play sports from time to time. My current short-term
            goals are to get chancellor's list again and to get an internship offer or two early in my application process.
