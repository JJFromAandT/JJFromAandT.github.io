    As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
<p id = "uline" a href="#">
    I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.
</p>
<p id = "org_BKG" a href="#">
It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.
</p>
In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
<p id = "red_text" a href="#">
"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...”
</p>
As his lips opened slightly with the suspocion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
<p id = "red_text" a href="#">
"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."
</p> 
And I felt him to be more fragile still.
<p id = "uline" a href="#">
I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...
